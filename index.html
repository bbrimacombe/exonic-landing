      <p>The largest revolution in history is afoot.</p>

      <p>Artificial intelligence will soon unlock the source code of life.</p>

      <p>For millennia, great minds have fantasized of curing all diseases and discovering eternal life. And while almost impossible to believe, this may now be only years away.</p>
      <p>This decade, the breakthroughs have been staggering, and it’s only accelerating.</p>

      <p><strong>July 15, 2021 – “Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold”. DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2 was used to predict structures for over 200 million proteins – covering nearly all known proteins on Earth – expanding the structural biology dataset by over 1,000×.</p>

      <p><strong>November 15, 2024 – “Sequence modeling and design from molecular to genome scale with Evo”. The Evo model was trained on 2.7 million prokaryotic and phage genomes. It demonstrated zero-shot functional prediction and successfully generated novel CRISPR-Cas systems, transposons, and de novo protein-RNA constructs.</p>

      <p><strong>December 17, 2024 – “Semantic mining of functional de novo genes from a genomic language model”. Evo 1.5 was prompted to generate anti-CRISPRs from CRISPR, and anti-toxins from toxins. In wet-lab tests, 39 % of anti-toxin candidates neutralized toxins in E. coli.</p>

      <p><strong>February 19, 2025 – “Genome modeling and design across all domains of life with Evo 2”. Evo 2 scaled to 9.3 trillion base pairs of training data from over 128,000 species. It set new state-of-the-art performance on 37 out of 42 benchmarks. Evo 2 generated full-length synthetic genomes with functional open reading frames and regulatory structure.</p>

      <p>GPT-4o was trained on around 10 trillion tokens — effectively most of the text ever written by humanity.</p>
      <p>But biological data exists on a scale unfathomably larger than human language.</p>

      <p>Consider that each human genome contains 3.2 billion base pairs of DNA. Across 8 billion people, that’s over 2.5 x 10^28 base pairs.</p>
      <p>A single human cell contains around 10 million RNA molecules. With trillions of cells per person, the number of unique RNA transcripts across humanity exceeds 10^32.</p>
      <p>The number of unique proteins is estimated to exceed 1 million per human individual. Across humanity, that’s 10^15 distinct proteoforms.</p>

      <p>This is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

      <p>Earth is home to an estimated 8.7 million eukaryotic species — and potentially over 1 trillion microbial species. Each bacterial species has its own genome, with 1–10 million base pairs. The total number of unique microbial genes is estimated to be over 10^12.</p>
      <p>There are an estimated 10^31 viruses on Earth — more than stars in the observable universe.</p>

      <p>And so on. In short, the amount of data available for biological foundation models is unlimited.</p>
      <p>So now what?</p>
      <p>These models are so new, that the industry is only beginning to grasp their implications — let alone productize them. As of the time of writing, Evo 2 has only 22 citations, despite being the most advanced genomic model ever built. There are no drugs on the market designed by biological foundation models.</p>
      <p>Companies like Profluent, Inceptive, and Cradle are building with these models — but all efforts are closed, preclinical, and exploratory.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, more than 2 million ordinary people have contributed to citizen science efforts like Foldit and Folding@Home, helping solve protein structures and simulate molecular dynamics from their personal devices. Make the models easy and fun to use, and build an open ecosystem of invention.</p>

      <p>And herein lies the thesis of Exonic AI.</p>

      <p>No one can predict what will happen. But we know that something will happen.<br />

      How do we bet on something?</p>

      <p>Exonic AI will tap into this human curiosity and build the App Store of biological foundation models.</p>
