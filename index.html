      <p>The largest revolution in history is afoot.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, generative models have rewritten what’s possible — in language, coding, mathematics, images, and video, and more.</p>
      <p>Next, artificial intelligence will unlock the source code of life.</p>

      </p>

      <p>For millennia, great minds have fantasized of curing all diseases and discovering eternal life. And while almost impossible to believe, this may now be only years away.</p>
      <p>This decade, the breakthroughs have been staggering, and it’s only accelerating.</p>

      <p><strong>July 15, 2021 – “Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold”</strong><br />
      DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2 achieved a median GDT score of 92.4 across 87 protein domains in CASP14, reaching near-experimental accuracy. It was later used to predict structures for over 200 million proteins – covering nearly all known proteins on Earth – expanding the structural biology dataset by over 1,000×.</p>

      <p><strong>November 15, 2024 – “Sequence modeling and design from molecular to genome scale with Evo”</strong><br />
      Evo, a 7-billion-parameter genomic language model, was trained on 2.7 million prokaryotic and phage genomes. It demonstrated zero-shot functional prediction and successfully generated novel CRISPR-Cas systems, transposons, and de novo protein-RNA constructs.</p>

      <p><strong>December 17, 2024 – “Semantic mining of functional de novo genes from a genomic language model”</strong><br />
      Evo 1.5 was prompted to generate anti-CRISPRs from CRISPR, and anti-toxins from toxins. It returned novel DNA sequences with no known homology. In wet-lab tests, 39 % of anti-toxin candidates neutralized toxins in E. coli.</p>

      <p><strong>February 19, 2025 – “Genome modeling and design across all domains of life with Evo 2”</strong><br />
      Evo 2 scaled to 40 billion parameters, trained on 9.3 trillion base pairs from over 128,000 species. It set new state-of-the-art performance on 37 out of 42 benchmarks, including variant effect prediction on ClinVar and epigenetic annotation across human cell types. Evo 2 generated full-length synthetic genomes with functional open reading frames and regulatory structure, demonstrating its ability to simulate and design biology across domains.</p>

      <p>GPT-4o was trained on around 10 trillion tokens — effectively most of the text ever written by humanity.</p>
      <p>But biological data exists on a scale unfathomably larger than human language.</p>

      <p>Consider that each human genome contains 3.2 billion base pairs of DNA. Across 8 billion people, that’s over 2.5 × 10²⁸ base pairs.</p>
      <p>A single human cell contains around 10 million RNA molecules, spanning messenger RNAs, regulatory RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and more. With trillions of cells per person, the number of unique RNA transcripts across humanity exceeds 10³².</p>
      <p>Then comes the proteome. While humans have around 20,000 protein-coding genes, the actual number of unique proteins (accounting for splicing, folding, and post-translational modifications) is estimated to exceed 1 million per individual. Across humanity, that’s 10¹⁵+ distinct proteoforms.</p>

      <p>This is the tip of the iceberg.</p>
      <p>Earth is home to an estimated 8.7 million eukaryotic species — and potentially over 1 trillion microbial species. Each bacterial species has its own genome, with 1–10 million base pairs. The total number of unique microbial genes is estimated to be over 10¹².</p>
      <p>There are an estimated 10³¹ viruses on Earth — more than stars in the observable universe.</p>
      <p>Essentially, the amount of data available for these new foundation models is unlimited.</p>
      <p>So now what?</p>
      <p>These models are so new, that the industry is only beginning to grasp their implications — let alone productize them. As of the time of writing, Evo 2 has only 22 citations, despite being the most advanced genomic model ever built. There are no drugs on the market designed by biological foundation models.</p>
      <p>Companies like Profluent, Inceptive, and Cradle are building with these models — but all efforts are closed, preclinical, and exploratory. It has been said to me by a top leader in the space “these are breakthrough tools looking for a breakthrough problem.”</p>

      <p>And herein lies the thesis of Exonic AI.</p>

      <p>No one can predict what will happen. But we know that something will happen.<br />
      How do we bet on something?</p>
      <p>More than 2 million ordinary people have contributed to citizen science efforts like Foldit and Folding@Home, helping solve protein structures and simulate molecular dynamics from their personal devices. Make the models easy and fun to use, and build an open ecosystem of invention.</p>
      <p>Exonic AI will tap into this human curiosity and build the App Store of biological foundation models.</p>
