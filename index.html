      <p>The largest revolution in history is afoot.</p>

      <p>Artificial intelligence will soon unlock the source code of life.</p>

      <p>For millennia, great minds have fantasized of curing all diseases and discovering eternal life.</p>

      <p>This is now only years away.</p>

      <p><strong>July, 2021. DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2 was used to predict structures for over 200 million proteins – covering nearly all known proteins on Earth – expanding the structural biology dataset by over 1,000×.</p>

      <p><strong>November, 2024. The Evo model was trained on 2.7 million prokaryotic and phage genomes. It demonstrated zero-shot functional prediction and successfully generated novel CRISPR-Cas systems, transposons, and de novo protein-RNA constructs.</p>

      <p><strong>December, 2024. Evo 1.5 was prompted to generate anti-CRISPRs from CRISPR, and anti-toxins from toxins. In wet-lab tests, 50% of anti-toxin candidates neutralized toxins in E. coli.</p>

      <p><strong>February, 2025. Evo 2 scaled to 9.3 trillion base pairs of training data from 128,000 species. Evo 2 generates full synthetic genomes with functional open reading frames and regulatory structure.</p>

      <p>GPT-4o was trained on around 10 trillion tokens — most of the text ever written by humanity.</p>

      <p>Biological data exists on an unfathomably larger scale.</p>

      <p>Each human genome contains 3.2 billion base pairs of DNA. Across 8 billion people, that’s 2.5 x 10^28 base pairs.</p>

      <p>A single human cell contains 10 million RNA molecules. With trillions of cells per person, the number of unique RNA transcripts across humanity exceeds 10^32.</p>

      <p>The number of unique proteins exceeds 1 million per human individual. Across humanity, that’s 10^15 distinct proteoforms.</p>

      <p>This is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

      <p>Earth is home to an estimated 8.7 million eukaryotic species — and potentially over 1 trillion microbial species.</p>

      <p>There are an estimated 10^31 viruses on Earth — more than stars in the observable universe.</p>

      <p>...An so on. In short, the amount of data available for biological foundation models is unlimited.</p>

      <p>So now what?</p>

      <p>These models are so new, that the industry is only beginning to grasp their implications — let alone productize them. As of the time of writing, Evo 2 has only 22 citations. There are no drugs on the market designed by biological foundation models.</p>

      <p>Companies like Profluent, Inceptive, and Cradle are building with these models — but efforts are closed, preclinical, and exploratory.</p>

      <p>And herein lies the thesis of Exonic AI.</p>

      <p>No one can predict what will happen. But we know that something will happen.<br />

      <p>How do we bet on something?<br />

      <p>More than 2 million ordinary people have contributed to citizen science efforts like Foldit and Folding@Home, helping solve protein structures and simulate molecular dynamics from their personal devices.</p>

      <p>How do we bet on human curiosity and inginuity?<br />

      <p>Exonic AI will tap into human curiosity and build the app store of biological foundation models.</p>

      <p><strong>Master plan</strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong>1. Make bio foundation models easy, fun, and accessible to everyone.</strong><br />
        - No PhD required. Simple, minimalist, fun UI<br />
        - Accessible via web & mobile<br />
        - Gamify: leaderboard and open sharing<br />
        - Real-world utility: let users submit designs to wet labs for validation with the click of a button<br />
        - “Help cure cancer from your couch”<br />
        - Monetization via $19.99/mo, $250–500 wet-lab sponsorships, and premium tools. 10,000 paying users is > $2.4 M ARR
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2. Move upstream to researchers</strong><br />
        - Build on the open community by offering next-gen bioinformatics infrastructure<br />
        - Give researchers fine-grained control: embeddings, mutational scanning, genome-wide modeling<br />
        - Allow labs to bring their own data, fine-tune foundation models, or deploy private versions<br />
        - Monetize via SaaS research licenses, enterprise API tiers, and institutional partnerships
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3. Drug discovery</strong><br />
        - Surface the best user and researcher-generated sequences for downstream development<br />
        - Partner with biotech firms or spin out internal programs targeting high-confidence molecules<br />
        - Generate and license IP around novel proteins, antibodies, RNA therapeutics, and more<br />
        - At scale, this becomes not just a platform — but a new kind of pharmaceutical company powered by open resources and continuous discovery
